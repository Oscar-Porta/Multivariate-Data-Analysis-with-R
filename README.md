# Multivariate Data Analysis with R – UNED Assessment (Module 4)

This repository contains a full practical assessment for Module 4 – Multivariate Data Analysis, developed as part of the Master's in Big Data and Data Science Applied to Economics and Business at UNED (2024–2025).

## 🎯 Objective

To apply theoretical knowledge of multivariate statistical techniques using R to real-world data. This includes building, interpreting, and visualizing models across four analytical domains.

## 🧪 Exercises Overview

### 1. Discriminant Analysis
- Construction of a discriminant function based on clients' net worth and debt.
- Calculation of centroids and cut-off point.
- Classification of new cases using the model.

### 2. Factor Analysis
- Exploratory Factor Analysis (EFA) using survey data on hospital service quality.
- Assessment of communalities and specificities.
- Interpretation of factors, explained variance, and creation of a biplot.
- Generation of factor scores and descriptive analysis.

### 3. Multidimensional Scaling (MDS)
- Non-metric MDS applied to unemployment rate data from Cantabria (2005–2020).
- Similarity evaluation across time series.

### 4. Canonical Correlation Analysis (CCA)
- CCA between physical characteristics of vehicles and performance/price indicators using the `MASS::Cars93` dataset.
- Interpretation of canonical dimensions and correlations.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries

- R  
- `psych`, `MASS`, `ggplot2`, `dplyr`, `reactable`, `corrplot`  
- RMarkdown for full reproducible reporting

## 📁 Files Included
